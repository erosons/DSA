Data Structure is driven by
  -Big O notation is an algebraic way to express Space and time complexity of a programming process

Algorithm are set of step/approach used to solve particular task/problem

  Key Components that defined good Algorithm.

    - Correctness
    - Efficiency
         - Time Complexity -> Running Time
             The benchmark for measuring efficiency in terms of time is using a worse case scenario is using the last nth trial 
             In this case a range 1-100 search 100th trial to get the target value 100 will be worst case scenario
         - Space Complexity -> Memory Usage

Algorithm Must have
------------------

	- Step:1 An Algorithm must be clear and  have clearly defined problem statement
	
	- Step:2 There must be an input ,There must be an output 
	
	- Step:3 They must contain specific instruction set defined in a particular order of execution
	
	- Step:4 The algorithm must complete and should not take the infinite amount of time {for different same 
	- input scenario} -> this makes the algorithm correct
	
	- Step:5 The Step must be distinct
	
	- Step:6 The execution step should not break into further subtast
  
  - Step:7 The final output an algorithm must be consistent each time it is rerun {for different same input scenario} -> this makes the algorithm
